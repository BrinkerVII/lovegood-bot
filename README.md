# Lovegood Discord bot
The Lovegood Discord bot is a bot for the popular chat application Discord (obviously).
The bot is currently targeted at one of the servers I (BrinkerVII) am in. There are a lot of
fans of the Harry Potter franchise in said server. This bots provides several magical functions.

If you didn't notice yet, the bot is named after Luna Lovegood. She is one of the quirky
characters in the Harry Potter universe (Don't sue pls).

# Roadmap
There are a handful of things I personally want the bot to do. I'll try to keep this list of things
up to date here in the readme ^^. If you have any suggestions, you may post them as GitHub
issues.

- Clash command âœ“
- Player bank / wallet thing (WIP)
- Command bundles
- Role Based Access Control
